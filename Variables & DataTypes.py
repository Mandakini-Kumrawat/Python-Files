# Chapter - 2 Practice Set 
# Variables & Data Types.

# 1. Write A Python Program To Add Two Numbers. 
# a = 2 
# b = 7
# print ( a + b ) 

# 2. Write A Python Program To Find Remainders When A Number Is Divided By 2. 
# a = int ( input ( " Give The Number : " ) ) 
# b = 2 
# print ( " Answer : " , a % b ) 

# 3. Check The Type Of Variable Assigned Using Input () Function. 
# a = input ( " Enter The Value : " ) 
# print ( type ( a ) ) 

# 4. Use Comparison Operator To Find Out Whether A Given Variable a Is Greater Than b Or Not. Take a = 34 and b = 80.
# a = int ( input ( " Enter First Number : " ) ) 
# b = int ( input ( " Enter Second Number : " ) ) 
# print ( a > b ) 

# 5. Write A Python Program To Find The Average Of Two Number Entered By Users. 
# a = int ( input ( " Enter First Number : " ) )
# b = int ( input ( " Enter Second Number : " ) )
# c = ( a + b ) / 2
# print ( " Answer : " , c )  

# 6. Write A Python Program To Calculate The Square Of A Number Entered By User. 
# n = int ( input ( " Enter Number : " ) )
# print ( " Answer : " , n ** 2 )
