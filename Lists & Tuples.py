# Chapter - 4 Practice Set 
# Lists & Tuples.

# 1. Write A Python Program To Store Seven Fruits In A List Entered By User.
# fruits = [] 
# f1 = int ( input ( " Enter First Fruit : ) " ) 
# fruits.append ( f1 ) 
# f2 = int ( input ( " Enter Second Fruit  ): " ) 
# fruits.append ( f2 ) 
# f3 = int ( input ( " Enter Third Fruit : ) " ) 
# fruits.append ( f3 ) 
# f4 = int ( input ( " Enter Fourth Fruit  ): " ) 
# fruits.append ( f4 ) 
# print ( " \n Your Complete List : " , fruits )

# 2. Write A Python Program To Accept Marks Of 6 Student And Display Them In A Sorted Manner. 
# marks = [] 
# n1 = int ( input ( " First Student : " ) ) 
# marks.append ( n1 )  
# n2 = int ( input ( " Second Student : "  )) 
# marks.append ( n2 ) 
# n3 = int ( input ( " Third Student : " ) ) 
# marks.append ( n3 ) 
# n4 = int ( input ( " Fourth Student : "  )) 
# marks.append ( n4 ) 
# n5 = int ( input ( " Fifth Student : " ) ) 
# marks.append ( n5 ) 
# n6 = int ( input ( " Sixth Student : " ) ) 
# marks.append ( n6 ) 
# marks.sort ()
# print ( " List Of Marks : " , marks ) 

# 3. Check That A Tuple Type Cannot Be Changed In Python. 
# a = ( 44 , 2 , " MK " ) 
# a [ 2 ] = "MK" 
# print ( a ) 

# 4. Write A Python Program To Sum A List With 4 Numbers.
# a = [ 2 , 7 , 4 , 1 ] 
# print ( sum ( a ) ) 

# 5. Write A Program To Count The Number Of Zeros In The Following Tuple. 
# a = ( 7 , 0 , 8 , 0 , 0 , 9 ) 
# a = ( 7 , 0 , 8 , 0 , 0 , 9 ) 
# print ( " Answer : " ,  a.count ( 0 ) )
